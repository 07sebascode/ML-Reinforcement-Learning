# Reinforcement Learning - Assignment

*Work in progress - please check back for updates.*

## Part 1 - Improve Cart-Pole

If you've not already, complete through goal 2 of [Coding Challenge 1](../cc1/).
The first part of the assignment is to improve the policy for the agent that is
trying to keep the pole upright on the cart in the notebook
[16_reinforcement_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/16_reinforcement_learning.ipynb).
Read the notebook through `A simple hard-coded policy`, and then add your own
code (in your local Docker-powered environment) to try to do better.

As noted, the main problem with the simple approach is that it ends up moving
the cart too abruptly and losing stability. You can refer to the later sections
of the notebook for some hints on ways to improve with various techniques, but
your goal here is to write your own code leveraging knowledge from the various
resources you have available.

Please turn in an updated notebook with your strategy, as well as text in the
notebook describing it and its performance.
